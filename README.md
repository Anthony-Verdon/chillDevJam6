# chillDevJam6

A little game made for the Chill Dev Jam 6.

The theme was "You shouldn't be here", with additionals themes "fast paced" and "banana". I decided to make a play where you need to find and rob a banana, but if you get caught you lose. You can hide but your vision will reduce over time.

My goal was to implement a FOV like Among Us, so I didn't focus on gameplay for this jam.

## Assets

I draw everything (that's why it's ugly)

## Possible upgrade

There is a bug where you character will still run when you hide while running.
I could add audio and more levels.
